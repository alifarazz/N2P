    - cleanup stdout messages.
    - each instance of any protocol should have a name.
      It makes it easier to identify which message belongs
      to which task.
    - controlprotocol should interact with client and server.
      . kill client
      . create client
      . disconnect clients from server ?
    - rest api with json between control and an external process.
      external processes include desktop gui app, tui app and
      maybe android app?
